1  MICROSERVICE ADVANTAGE:-
_____________________________
**   Microservices are self-contained, independent deployment module.
 *   Microservices are independently manageable services. It can enable more and more services as the need arises. 
     It minimizes the impact on existing service.
 *	 It is possible to change or upgrade each service individually rather than upgrading in the entire application.
 *   Microservices follows the single responsibility principle.
 *   The demanding service can be deployed on multiple servers to enhance performance.
 *   Dynamic scaling.
 *   Faster release cycle.
 
2  DISADVANTAGE:-
_____________________________
**   Microservices has all the associated complexities of the distributed system.
 *   There is a higher chance of failure during communication between different services.
 *   Difficult to manage a large number of services.
 *   Complex testing over a distributed environment.
 *   The developer needs to solve the problem, such as network latency and load balancing.
