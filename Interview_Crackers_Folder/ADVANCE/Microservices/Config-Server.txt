** CONFIG SERVER:-
___________________
**  Purpose:- (i) With microservices, we create a central config server where all configurable parameters of 
                  micro-services are written version controlled.
			 (ii) The benefit of a central config server is that if we change a property for a microservice,
          			 it can reflect that on the fly without redeploying the microservice.	  
				  
				  
	IMPLEMENTATIONS:-
________________________________________	
**  Add the dependency of config server.
 *  Use the @EnableConfigServer annotations on the top of main class.
 *  properties file:- spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=
 
 Note:- If we are creating any microservice then we don'y have to need the configure the configuration in properties file.
        Simply We will change those changes in properties file then we have to push on the GIT.
		So,from GIT that will be picked up all the configuration.
