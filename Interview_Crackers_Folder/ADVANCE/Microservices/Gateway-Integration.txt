________________________________
**  The purpose of the API Gateway is to represent a single point of entry to all those clients, and at the same
    time, to abstract the complexities of communication issues like  protocol transactions and data conversions.
 *  BENIFITS:- The API gateway is a protocol-agnostic solution that serves distinct clients across several
    communication channels.	
 *  It exposes each API for each consumer, according to the communication and client types, and  security 
    once it is the main entry point. 
 *  It abstracts any refactoring or break-down structures on existing systems (the so-called monoliths) to its
    clients, and abstracts underlying microservices topology and technologies involved to final consumers.
 *  DRAWBACKS:-adding a new layer to the overall architecture decreases the response time due to conversational 
    costs to request all microservices involved in a specific transaction in a particular business context.	
	
**** INTEGRATION PATTERN ****
________________________________
** Microservices architecture opts to replace the ESB with the building of smart endpoints and dumb pipes,
   meaning that your microservices have to take care of all the application integration.
