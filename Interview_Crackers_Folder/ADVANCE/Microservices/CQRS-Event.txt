** CQRS **       https://www.baeldung.com/cqrs-event-sourcing-java
___________________
**  CQRS is about segregating the command and query side of the application architecture.
 *  It is based on the Command Query Separation (CQS) principle.
 *  CQS suggests that we divide the operations on domain objects into two distinct categories: Queries and Commands:
 *  Queries return a result and do not change the observable state of a system. Commands change the state
    of the system but do not necessarily return a value. 
	
**  Event Sourcing  **
___________________________
**  Event Sourcing gives us a new way of persisting application state as an ordered sequence of events.
 *  We can selectively query these events and reconstruct the state of the application at any point in time to make this work.
 *  we need to reimage every change to the state of the application as events.
 *  These events here are facts that have happened and can not be altered â€” We can say, they must be immutable.
