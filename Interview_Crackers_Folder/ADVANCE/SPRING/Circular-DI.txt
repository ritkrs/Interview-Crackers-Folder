** How can i maintain circular dependencies.?
   * Bean A-->Bean B-->Bean A
   
   Sol(1):- A simple way of break circular dependency is:-Initialize one of the beans lazily.
             * That is instead of fully initializy the bean,it will create a proxy to inject into other bean.The  
           injected bean will only be fully created when it's first needed.
         
		 Eg:-public circularDependency(@Lazy CircularDependencyB circB)
		     {
			  this.circB=circB;
		     }
	
	Sol(2):-Use setter/field injection:-
             * We will not inject by constructor injection.
             * We will use setter injection:- By this way spring creates the beans but 
			   dependencies are not injected until they are needed.

    Sol(3):- We can also use @PostConstruct Annotation on method level and We
             can avoid circular dependency.
