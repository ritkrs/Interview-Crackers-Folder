** ANNOTATIONS WORK INTERNALLY:-
_______________________________________
**  Annotations are used to provide metadata for te java code, even though they are not part of the program itself.
**  Metadata is data about data.
**  So Annotations are metadata for source code.
**  Classes, methods, variables, parameters and packages can be annotated in Java.

************ The Annotations gives meaningful information such as: ************
______________________________________________________________________________
** (i)  Compiler instructions : Annotations can be used by the compiler to detect errors or suppress warnings.
** (ii) Build-time instructions : Software tools can process annotation information to generate code, XML files, and so forth.
** (iii)Runtime instructions : Some annotations are available to be examined at runtime.

**  Java has three built-in annotations:
___________________________________________
**  @Override : Checks that the method is an override. Causes a compile error if the method is not found in one
    of the parent classes or implemented interfaces.
**  @SuppressWarnings : Instructs the compiler to suppress the compile time warnings specified in the
    annotation parameters.
**  @Deprecated : Marks the method as obsolete. Causes a compile warning if the method is used.
