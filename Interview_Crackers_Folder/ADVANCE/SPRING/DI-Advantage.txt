** DI allows a client flexibility being configurable.Only clients behaviour fixed.
** Loosely couple architecture.
** Testing can be performed using Mock objects.  

** DI-Advantage of high cohesion Dependency injection:-
_________________________________________________________
** Reduced module complexity.
** Increased module reusability.
** Increased system maintaibility because logic changein the domain effect modules.
** DI allows concurrent or independent development.	

** Disadvantages:-
________________________	
** DI creates clients that demand configure details supplied by costruction injection code.
** Tight Coupling.
** DI cause an explosion of types,especially in languages that have explicit interface.
