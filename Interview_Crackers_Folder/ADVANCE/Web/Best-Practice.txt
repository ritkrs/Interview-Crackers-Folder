**  REST-API BEST PRACTICES:-
___________________________________
** (i)  Accept and respond with JSON.
 * (ii) Handle errors gracefully and return standard error codes.
          
		  ** Standard Error codes:-**
		  400 Bad Request – This means that client-side input fails validation.
          401 Unauthorized – This means the user isn’t not authorized to access a resource. It usually returns when the user isn’t authenticated.
          403 Forbidden – This means the user is authenticated, but it’s not allowed to access a resource.
          404 Not Found – This indicates that a resource is not found.
          500 Internal server error – This is a generic server error. It probably shouldn’t be thrown explicitly.
          502 Bad Gateway – This indicates an invalid response from an upstream server.
          503 Service Unavailable – This indicates that something unexpected happened on server side (It can be anything like server overload, some parts of the system failed, etc.).
		  
 * (iii)Allow filtering, sorting, and pagination.
 * (iv) We can use Cache data to improve performance.
 * (v)  We should maintain the Versioning our APIs.
 * (vi) We should Always use Data Transfer Objects.
 * (vii)If it is possible,We should always Maintain Good Security Practices.
