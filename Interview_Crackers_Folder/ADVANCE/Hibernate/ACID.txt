** ACID:-
  
(1) Atomicity: Is defined as either all operations can be done or all operation can be undone
(2) Consistency: After a transaction is completed successfully, the data in the datastore should be a reliable data.
    This reliable data is also called as consistent data
(3) Isolation: If two transactions are going on the same data then one transaction will not disturb the other transaction
(4) Durability: After a transaction is completed, the data in the datastore will be permanent until another transaction is going to be performed on that data
