** Advantage:-
________________
** Hibernate provides the ORM features.
** It supports Inheritance,associations,Collections.
** Hibernate have its own Query language which is database independent(HQL).
** Hibernate have capability to generate primary keys while storing the data into the database.
** In JDBC We have only checked exceptions,so we have to write all code inside try and catch block or throws keyboard.
** But In case of Hibernate we have onlyunchecked exceptions,so we don't need to write code inside 
   checked or inside try or catch block.
** Hibernate handles all lower level sql. 

** Disadvantage:-
_________________________________
** Biolarplate Code issue:- We need to write same code in several files in same application.  
** It's little bit slow compare to JDBC,because it's generate lot's of sql queries at Runtime.
