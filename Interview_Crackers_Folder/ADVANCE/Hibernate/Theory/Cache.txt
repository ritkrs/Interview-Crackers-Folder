** CACHING:- Caching improve the performance by pooling object in the cache.

(1) FIRST LEVEL CACHE:-(i)Session holds the first level cache.
    (ii) It is enabled by default.
	(iii)In this case,data is not available into the entire application.
	(iv) An application can use Many session object.
	
(2)	SECOND LEVEL CACHE:-(i)Session factory holds the 2nd level cache data.
    (ii)  The data stored in 2nd level cache will be available to entire application.
	(iii) We need to enable 2nd level cache explicitly.
	(iv)  Hibernate 2nd level cache uses common cache for all session object of a session factory.
	(v)   It is useful if We have multiple session objects from a session factory.
