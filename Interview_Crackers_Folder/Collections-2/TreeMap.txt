** HashMap:-
____________
**  Java HashMap is a hashtable based implementation of Map interface.
**  HashMap implements Map, Cloneable, and Serializable interface.
**  HashMap allows a single null key and multiple null values.
**  HashMap allows heterogeneous elements because it does not perform sorting on keys.
**  HashMap is faster than TreeMap because it provides constant-time performance that is O(1) for the 
     basic operations like get() and put().
**  HashMap does not maintain any order.
**  The HashMap should be used when we do not require key-value pair in sorted order.	 
	 
** TreeMap:-
__________________
**  Java TreeMap is a Tree structure-based implementation of Map interface.
**  TreeMap implements NavigableMap, Cloneable, and Serializable interface.
**  TreeMap does not allow null keys but can have multiple null values.
**  TreeMap allows homogeneous values as a key because of sorting.
**  TreeMap is slow in comparison to HashMap because it provides the performance of O(log(n)) for 
     most operations like add(), remove() and contains().
**  The elements are sorted in natural order (ascending).
**  The TreeMap should be used when we require key-value pair in sorted (ascending) order.
