**  Partnering for client impact:-
_______________________________________
(1)  Building trust:-You must overcome gaps in terminology, expectations, and different past experiences,”.
(2)  Proper Communication.

     ** We should always keep in mind this thing:-
____________________________________________________

** Respond promptly.
** Always summarize next steps.

** Client Impact:-
__________________________
 (1)  In-person communication. 
 (2)  Take initiative
 (3)  Overcommunicate:- Touch base, check in, update, and take the client’s temperature so often that the client 
      knows your number when it pops up on caller ID. Don’t do the expected level of communication—do more than
	  expected. Communicate it, communicate it again, and then communicate it one more time.
 (4)  Take initiative.
 (5)  Do it yourself.
 (6)  Step over the line. There are social barriers we worry about crossing. Cross them. Don’t hold back. These 
      folks aren’t your best friends; they’re more than that. Your duty to your clients is higher than your duty
	  to a friend. These folks are paying you for advice. You owe them every thought you’ve got. Give it to them
	  even when it’s uncomfortable and awkward. Don’t be constrained by social convention; there’s too much on
	  the line.
