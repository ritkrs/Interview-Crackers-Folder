** PREVENT SINGLETON CLASS:-
_____________________________________
*Q. How to prevent singleton pattern reflection??.
    
**  1. Enums:- Enums Dont have any constructor.(Reflection).
  * So,We can't invoke the enum directly by ourself.
  * J.V.M handles creation and invocation of enum constructor internaly.
  * Enum's don't have any constructor,so its not possible that reflection will access singleton.
     Hence,Reflection can't break the singleton property in case of enums.
		  
  * 2. Serialization:- By using Read and Resolve Method.

  * 3. Cloning: - Overide clone() throw Exception.
  * To overcome this issue override clone() and throw an exception from clone() method that is clone not supported exception.  
	 Now,whenever user try to create clone of singleton object,it will throw exception and hence our class remains singleton.
