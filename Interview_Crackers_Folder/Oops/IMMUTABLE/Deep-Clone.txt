** DEEP CLONING:-
___________________
1.   Why Deep Copy is important for immutability?
     (i)  HashMap values got changed because of shallow copy in the constructor.
     (ii)Itâ€™s happening because of the direct reference to the original object in the getter function.
	 
2. * In case of Deep Cloning all the fields are copied. In this case even the objects referenced are copied
     in the cloned object along with the fields. 
   * This can be achieved by making new object for those reference 
	 and then mapping with the class.
   * This will ensure that the original and cloned objects doesnot share any 
	 common thing that could lead to problems.
