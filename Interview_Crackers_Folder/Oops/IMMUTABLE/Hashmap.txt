**  MUTABLE OBJECT AS A KEY:-
_______________________________
**  If We want to make a mutable object as key in hashmap, then We have to make sure that state change
    for key object does not change the hash code of object.
 *  For maintaing this we should compolsory maintain the contract of the hashcode() and equals().
 *  For maintaing the contract, Compolsory we should override hashcode() and equal() method.
