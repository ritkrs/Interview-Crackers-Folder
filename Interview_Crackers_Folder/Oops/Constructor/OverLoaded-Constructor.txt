(1)  OVERLOADED CONSTRUCTOR:-
     (i) A class can contain more than one constructor and all these constructors having the same name
      	 but different arguments and hence these constructors are considered as overloaded constructors. 
		 
	(ii)  recursive method call is always runtime exception where as recursive constructor 
	       invocation is a compile time error. 	 
		 
		 
		 
  NOTE:-(1) “Inheritance concept is not applicable for constructors and hence overriding concept
            also not applicable to the constructors. But constructors can be overloaded”. 	

        (2) We can take constructor in any java class including abstract class also but we
          		can’t take constructor inside inheritance.
