RULES TO WRITE CONSTRUCTORS:
 *  Name of the constructor and name of the class must be same. 
 
 *  RETURN TYPE :-
 
 *  RETURN TYPE  concept is not applicable for constructor even void also by mistake if we are declaring 
    the return type for the constructor we wonâ€™t get any compile time error and runtime error compiler simply
	treats it as a method.
	
 *  ACCESS MODIFIER:-
 
 *  The only applicable modifiers for the constructors are PUBLIC, DEFAULT, PRIVATE, PROTECTED. 
 *  If we are using any other modifier we will get compile time error.
