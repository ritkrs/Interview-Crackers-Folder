(1)  SUPER():-The 1st line inside constructor should be either suoer() or this() if we are not writing anything
               compiler will always generate super().
	CASE 1:-We have to take super() or this() only in the 1st line of constructor.If We are 
             taking anywhere else we will get compile time error.
    CASE 2:-We can use either super() or this() but not simultaneously.
    CASE 3:-We can use super() or this() only inside constructor.If We are using anywhere else We
               will get compile time error.


Example: 
(1) SUPER(),THIS():-
    1. These are constructors calls.
	2. We should use only inside constructors.
	
(2)	SUPER,THIS:-

   1. These are keywords which can be used to call parent class and current class instance members.  
   2. We can use anywhere except static area.
