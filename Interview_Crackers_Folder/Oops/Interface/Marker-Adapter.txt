** MARKER INTERFACE **
______________________________
** If an interface doesnâ€™t contain any methods and by implementing that interface if our object gets some ability
   such type of interfaces are called Marker interface (or) Tag interface (or) Ability interface. 
   
** ADAPTER CLASS **
______________________________
** Adapter class is a simple java class that implements an interface only with empty implementation
   for every method.    
 * If we implement an interface directly for each and every method compulsory we should provide implementation
   whether it is required or not. This approach increases length of the code and reduces readability.  
 * We can resolve this problem by using adapter class. 
 * Instead of implementing an interface if we can extend adapter class we have to provide implementation 
   only for required methods but not for all methods of that interface.  
 * This approach decreases length of the code and improves readability.
