NAMING CONFLICTS: 
______________________
** METHODS:- **
______________________
 *  If two interfaces contain a method with same signature and same return type in the implementation
    class only one method implementation is enough. 
 *  if two interfaces contain a method with same name but different arguments in the implementation class
    we have to provide implementation for both methods and these methods acts as a overloaded methods.
 *  If two interfaces contain a method with same signature but different return types then it is 
    not possible to implement both interfaces simultaneously. 	

Q. We canâ€™t write any java class that implements both interfaces simultaneously. Is a java class
   can implement any no. Of interfaces simultaneously? 
Ans:- Yes, except if two interfaces contains a method with same signature but different return types. 

** VARIABLES **
______________________
 * Two interfaces can contain a variable with the same name and there may be a chance variable naming 
   conflicts but we can resolve variable naming conflicts by using interface names.
